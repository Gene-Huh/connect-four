#### Rules
-   Each player may drop only one checker into the grid per turn.
-   A winner is declared when one player gets four of their colored checkers aligned vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
-   Other configurations, such as squares, don't count as winning combinations.
-   The game results in a draw if no player has formed a line of four and there are no more spaces remaining in the grid.

#### User Stories
- Create an empty game board to begin a game with.
-   Create a mechanism for choosing which column to drop a disc into.
	- In the case of a command line interface, you may choose to enter a column number or have an arrow above the columns that you can move with the arrow keys and press the Enter/Return key to accept.
	- In the case of a graphical user interface, you may choose to enter a column number or have the user hover over a column with their mouse and click.- Prevent a player from dropping a disc into a column that is full.
- Display the resting location for a disc dropped onto a given column.
- Alternate moves between two players.
- Detect and display a winner.
- Detect and display a draw.
- After a game is completed, allow for another game to be started without having to restart your program from the beginning.
- **CHALLENGE:** Develop an automated computer player. Consider using an AI solution. Here is an API you may use to request the computer playerâ€™s next move [Connect Four API](http://kevinalbs.com/connect4/back-end/info.html)
